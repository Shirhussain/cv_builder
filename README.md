# how to fire up this program 

first of all you have to install requirements. for working with PDF in html so you have to install another app, if you are like me using linux so you life is easy, all you need to do is install with this command "sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf ". but if you have in window you have to install the same app but i don't know how to install you just need to search on internet.
